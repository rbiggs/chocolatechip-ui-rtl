ChocolateChip-UI for Right-to-Left Languages Using the Arabic and Hebrew Alphabets

This version of ChocolateChip-UI uses the jQuery library. To facilitate users of right-to-left languages, this version changes not only the direciton of text but also the direciton of navigation, placement of back buttons, etc. Everything is essentially flipped for a true right-to-left experience, providing Arabic and Hebrew speakers with an interface experience as appropriate for their expectations. 

By default, all text is right-to-left. If you wish to include left-to-right text interspersed in your right-to-left text, you'll need to put it in a span or similar tag with the property:

    dir='ltr'
